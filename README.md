# Melbot

Melbot is a project I started after playing around with OpenAI's content moderation API. Since I use discord as a form of communication, I tried to make a discord bot using OpenAI's API. I relied heavily on documentation and online discord.js guides to help me build this bot. It can be used to moderate text messages in discord servers with 80% accuracy.
