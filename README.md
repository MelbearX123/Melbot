# Melbot

Melbot is a project I started after playing around with OpenAI's content moderation API. Since I use discord as a form of communication, I tried to make a discord bot using OpenAI's API. I relied heavily on documentation and online discord.js guides to help me build this bot. It is currently IN PROGRESS but I plan to finish it in the coming weeks.
